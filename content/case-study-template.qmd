## File naming convention

Please name your case study file with the following convention: `OFFICE-region-species.qmd`

For example:
`AFSC-BSAI-pollock.qmd`


## Edit and add your pages

Each page should start with 
```
---
title: your title
---
```
and the first header will be the 2nd level, so `## `. Note, there are situations where you leave off
```
---
title: your title
---
```
and start the qmd file with a level header `# `, but if using the default title yaml (in the `---` fence) is a good habit since it makes it easy for Quarto convert your qmd file to other formats (like into a presentation).

## Add a chunk of code describing your setup

Case study files should include:

* R version
* TMB version
* FIMS commit
* Name of your stock
* Name of your region
* Name of the analyst

Please ensure that the [`content/setup.qmd`](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/case-studies/blob/main/content/setup.qmd) file is updated if the case study requires the installation of additional R packages.
